# Privacy policy for the app "Wakelock v3"

The app neither collects nor shares any data.

If the user wants it, the app can acquire a wakelock for the duration of a phone call.
To know when a phone call begins and when it ends it requires the permission `READ_PHONE_STATE`.

If you have further questions, just send me a mail.
